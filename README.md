**Goal of the project:**
Predict the impact of different variables on the sleep efficiency (of our sample)

**Description of dataset**
- Name: Sleep Efficiency Dataset
- Source: The dataset provided was collected as part of a study conducted in the UK by a research team from The University of Oxfordshire. Downloaded from Kaggle.com
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency
- Features: 15 columns & 452 rows

The dataset contains information about a group of test subjects and their sleep patterns.
- Each test subject is identified by a unique "Subject ID" and their age and gender are also recorded.
- The "Bedtime" and "Wakeup time" features indicate when each subject goes to bed and wakes up each day, and the "Sleep duration" feature records the total amount of time each subject slept in hours.
- The "Sleep efficiency" feature is a measure of the proportion of time spent in bed that is actually spent asleep.
- The "REM sleep percentage", "Deep sleep percentage", and "Light sleep percentage" features indicate the amount of time each subject spent in each stage of sleep.
- The "Awakenings" feature records the number of times each subject wakes up during the night. Additionally, the dataset includes information about each subject's caffeine and alcohol consumption in the 24 hours prior to bedtime, their smoking status, and their exercise frequency.
    - caffeine_consumption: the amount of caffeine consumed in the 24 hours prior to bedtime (in mg)
    - alcohol_consumption: the amount of alcohol consumed in the 24 hours prior to bedtime (in oz)

**Plan**

Day 1:

Clean data.

	- Assess what to do with the NaNs
	- Changing data types
	- Converting time stamps into time-bins
	- Converting ‘Gender’ values into dummy variables

Day 2:
Explore data & creation of model.

	- Checking data distribution
	- Remove outliers
	- Train/Test split data
	- Transform
	- Run linear regression
	- Interpretation of results
	- Model Evaluation
	- Improve Model (eventually changing the scale, removing variables, etc.)
